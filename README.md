  ## Installation
  
  This app is hosted on heroku. You can access the app by clicking [here](https://peaceful-wave-27585.herokuapp.com/).


  ## Usage
  
  The app has a list of pre-defined burgers in its database that are ready to be devoured. If you click on the devour button next to each item in that list, it will be moved to the list of devoured burgers on the right side of the page. You can also create new burgers by typing their names in the provided form on the page and clicking the submit button that will then add them to the list of burgers ready to be devoured on the left side of the page.
